For this project, I created a to do list that displays the current date, calculates how many days until a chosen deadline and can convert minutes to hours and minutes, that way you can get a better idea of how much time different task may take and manage your time a little better. The three features that I chose from the feature list are listed below:

•Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current
date, and display how many days remaining until some event). 
    I implemented this feature by creating a function that gets the current date, and creating form inputs that takes a set of dates and
    and return how many days are remaining between the two.

•Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it
(ex: converts cups to grams).
    I included this feature by creating an input that takes a total number of minutes and on click converts them to hours and minutes.

•Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters),
calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a
new value.
    This feature was included by creating form inputs that take two different date values, calculates the time in between them and returns a new value (number of days)

Two of the features that I was originally going to implement but found to be a little beyond my current skill level were:

•Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external
file

•Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
