For this project, I created a to do list that also calculates how many days until Christmas and can convert minutes to hours, that way you can get a better idea of how much time different task may take and manage your time a little better. The three features that I chose from the feature list are listed below:

•Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current
date, and display how many days remaining until some event).

•Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it
(ex: converts cups to grams).

•Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters),
calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a
new value.

The features that I was originally going to implement but found to be a little beyond my current skill level were:

•Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external
file

•Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
